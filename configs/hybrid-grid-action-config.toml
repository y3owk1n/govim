# Neru Configuration - Hybrid Mode (Grid for Move + Actions for Everything Else)
#
# This configuration uses:
# - Grid mode ONLY for move_mouse (precise cursor positioning)
# - Action commands for all click operations (left, right, double, etc.)
# - Hints mode is disabled
#
# This approach combines the best of both worlds:
# - Grid's precision for cursor positioning without hint selection overhead
# - Direct action commands for instant clicks at current cursor position
# - No need for hint/grid selection for simple click operations
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Use grid to move cursor to desired location
# 2. Use action hotkeys to perform clicks directly at cursor position
# 3. No intermediate hint selection step required
#
# Copy to:
#   - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/neru/config.toml
#   - XDG:   ~/.config/neru/config.toml
# Or use: neru launch --config /path/to/this/config.toml

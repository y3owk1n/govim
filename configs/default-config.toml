# Neru Configuration — Mini Docs

# Copy locations:
#   - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/neru/config.toml
#   - XDG:   ~/.config/neru/config.toml
# Or pass a custom path via the CLI: `neru launch --config /path/to/config.toml`
#
# Conventions
# - Colors: `#RGB`, `#RRGGBB`, or `#RRGGBBAA`.
# - Hotkeys: `Modifier+...+Key` with modifiers `Cmd`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, `Option`.
#   Examples: `Cmd+Shift+Space`, `Ctrl+D`. Set to "" to disable.
[general]
# Applications to exclude from Neru functionality
# Neru will do nothing when these applications are focused and pass through everything back to the os
# Use bundle IDs to identify applications. To find an app's bundle ID:
# osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'
# Examples:
# excluded_apps = [
#     "com.apple.Terminal",      # Terminal
#     "com.googlecode.iterm2",   # iTerm2
#     "com.microsoft.VSCode",    # VS Code
#     "com.apple.dt.Xcode",      # Xcode

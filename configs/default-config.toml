# Neru Configuration — Mini Docs

# Copy locations:
#   - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/neru/config.toml
#   - XDG:   ~/.config/neru/config.toml
# Or pass a custom path via the CLI: `neru launch --config /path/to/config.toml`
#
# Conventions
# - Colors: `#RGB`, `#RRGGBB`, or `#RRGGBBAA`.
# - Hotkeys: `Modifier+...+Key` with modifiers `Cmd`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, `Option`.
#   Examples: `Cmd+Shift+Space`, `Ctrl+D`. Set to "" to disable.
[general]
# Applications to exclude from Neru functionality
# Neru will do nothing when these applications are focused and pass through everything back to the os
# Use bundle IDs to identify applications. To find an app's bundle ID:
# osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'
# Examples:
# excluded_apps = [
#     "com.apple.Terminal",      # Terminal
#     "com.googlecode.iterm2",   # iTerm2
#     "com.microsoft.VSCode",    # VS Code
#     "com.apple.dt.Xcode",      # Xcode
# ]
excluded_apps = []

# Include additional targets in hint mode
# Show hints on the macOS menu bar
include_menubar_hints = false
# Show hints on the Dock (includes mission control)
include_dock_hints = false
# Show hints on the Notification Center
include_nc_hints = false

# Restore cursor position after action
# Restore cursor position after left click
restore_pos_after_left_click = false
# Restore cursor position after right click
restore_pos_after_right_click = false
# Restore cursor position after middle click
restore_pos_after_middle_click = false
# Restore cursor position after double click

# Per-app role configurations
# These allow you to add additional clickable/scrollable roles for specific applications
# The roles defined here are ADDED to the global roles above (not replaced)
# To find an app's bundle ID, run: osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'

# For example, in `Mail.app`, lots of element are `AXStaticText` and they should be clickable. In this case, we don't want to add to the global one, as it will causes lots of unclickable hints, especially in browser space.
# [[accessibility.app_configs]]
# bundle_id = "com.apple.mail"
# additional_clickable_roles = ["AXStaticText"]
# # You can also add scrollable roles scoped to the app:
# # additional_scrollable_roles = ["AXScrollArea"]

# For example, in `Chrome`, we can add support for tabgroups.
# [[accessibility.app_configs]]
# bundle_id = "com.google.Chrome"
# additional_clickable_roles = ["AXTabGroup"]

# You can do and customise alot more when the defaults or global are not good enough.
